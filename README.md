# React-Learning-Area

Welcome to my personal React Learning Area!

Inside this repository I will document my react learning process, starting with small static projects going to smaller functional applications.

Each project will have its own subfolder. This way, my account/repositories stay clean and learning projects can be clearly differentiated by serious future applications I will build.
