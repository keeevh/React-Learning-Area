# Static Receipt Dashboard

This learning project used a design from <a href="https://dribbble.com/haloweb" target="_blank">Halo UI/UX</a> | <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/18028532-Admin-dashboard-analytics-UX" target="_blank">Design</a>

## Learning Goal

I'm creating this project to make my muscle memory more familiar with writing react components. I will also seperate components into different files (as its suitable) and try to make this static page as interactive as possible with CSS and JS.
