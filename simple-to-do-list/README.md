## Simple React To-Do List

# Learnings
Welcome to this project! Since I've created a very basic to-do app during my vanilla JS learning I've decided to program a new to-do app using my new basic react knowledge. This way I can improve my react muscle memory, get a better understanding of how to structure components and program functions inside class components.

# Goal
By the end of this project this will be a fully functional to-do application. This app will have a "+" button in the bottom right which expands a slider from the bottom where you can add new to-do's to your list.

Every to-do can be edited, deleted and marked as finished. As the project grows I will also include filter to display already finished tasks.

More information to be added soon!
